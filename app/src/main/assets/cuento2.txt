Once upon a time down on an old farm, lived a duck family, and Mother Duck
had been sitting on a clutch of new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched
and out popped six chirpy ducklings.
But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it didn't hatch. Before she had time to
think about it, the last egg hatched.
A strange looking duckling with gray feathers that should have been yellow
gazed at a worried mother. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck had a
secret worry.
- I can't understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine! she said to
herself.
The ugly duckling was hated by his brothers and sisters. They would often
mock at him. The ugly duckling felt so sad that he ran away from home one
day. He spent the rest of his day and night crying all alone. He felt lonely and
miserable but the ugly duckling was hopeful in his heart.
One morning, the duckling saw the beautiful swans around him. The duckling
was ashamed of himself and bent his head low. He saw beneath the water his
own reflection. It was the reflection of a swan. He was no longer a grey, ugly
bird. The duckling was amazed. Actually, he had grown into a beautiful swan.
Those beautiful swans were his brothers and sisters.
The ugly duckling remembered how everyone used to ignore him. The ugly
duckling now heard the swans say that he was the most beautiful among them.
Now he was no more the ugly duckling.
