Once upon a time lived a wood carver named Geppetto. He made puppets
from pieces of wood, and he called his favorite puppet Pinocchio.
- I would love to be a father to a real boy like Pinocchio- he wished.
That night, the blue fairy, who knew Geppetto was a good man, cost a magic
spell over Pinocchio. The very next day, Gappetto awake and was very happy to
find that Pinocchio could walk, sit and talk like a real boy.
Geppetto wanted to send Pinocchio to school. He sold his only coat for a
spelling book.
- Now you can go to school like a real boy -s aid Gappetto as we waved
goodbye to Pinocchio.
On the way to school, Pinocchio stopped to wacth a puppet show in a town.
- How would you like to join my puppet show? - asked the evil puppet master.
Pinocchio happily agreed. He was locked inside the evil puppet master’s
caravan. He wished he was safe with Geppetto. The blue fairy suddenly
appeared. She had heard Pinocchio’s wish and set him free. Pinocchio is
happy to be free.
