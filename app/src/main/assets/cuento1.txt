Lisa lives with her dog, Fluffy.
Fluffy never eats anything that costs less than 50 dollars. He has a really
expansive taste.
One day Fluffy gets lost. Lisa looks for him everywhere, but she can't find him.
"Fluffy, my friend, you are on your own," she says.
Poor Fluffy walks and walks. He is not sure where to turn, and it is already time
for his 4 o'clock snack.
"What should I do?" Fluffy thinks.
Now it is 8 o'clock, and Fluffy is really hungry. He wants to eat, and he wants
his 8 o'clock bath.
"Oh, no" Fluffy thinks.
Now it is 10 o'clock, and Fluffy is extremely hungry. He wants his snack, his
dinner, his bath and his soft bed.
Suddenly he spots a big gray dog, with a big gray nose.
The big gray dog chews something.
Fluffy tries not to stare, but he is really hungry by now.
"What do you want?" The big gray dog asks.
"Hmm, wellâ€¦ Maybe you could give me some food and snacks, and a bath
too?"
The dog smiles, "A bath?"
"Yes, a bath. I am tired, and hungry, and dirty," Fluffy answers.
"Well, of course I can. Come into my spa."
The big dog laughs and walks away.
